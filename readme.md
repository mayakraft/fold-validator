# FOLD viewer and validator

The FOLD file format is a new (2016) mesh file format made especially for modeling origami. This is a web app which can validate a FOLD file and create a rendering of the model in WebGL.

# demo

# developers

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

However, this requires the nightly build of [Rabbit Ear](https://github.com/rabbit-ear/rabbit-ear), the current `dev` branch. You will see the relative path in `package.json`, ensure yours matches. Then this app should build just fine.
